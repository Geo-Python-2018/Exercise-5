    "In this problem the aim is to aggregate the hourly temperature data for Helsinki Kumpula and Rovaniemi weather stations to a daily level. Currently, there are 3 measurements per hour in the data. This problem is more challenging as we provide only minimal instructions for completing the given tasks.\n",

    "\n",
    "  - a new DataFrame where you have calculated mean, max and min temperatures for each day separately using the\n",
    "  hourly values from Rovaniemi and Helsinki Kumpula.\n",
    "  - remember to comment your code\n",
    "  - submit your solution to Github\n",

    "Find help from [Pandas Official documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) and Google. If you think you can handle this but don't know how to proceed, ask in Slack for tips.\n"
